write a 1-2 paragraph proposal explaining the concept for your non-linear narrative
I'm very interested in free verse poetry, and shifting the mental state of the player. I really liked a twine called "Pet Cats Save the World" by Diregris, as well as "a partial list of things for which i am grateful" by Devon Guinn. Furthermore, I like how some games let you rotate/cycle through a choice, such as in "Mirror" by bvcw you can click on the purple words until deciding which word you wants to use. My goal is to integrate these interests in an experimental way and hopefully learn how to do the word cycling technique, as well as insert images and/or edit the colors of the game. 
Specifically, I am playing with the idea of going through the mind of somebody who can't fall asleep at night. I'll do some non-chronological moments where the person thinks back to earlier in the day, but also want to be loose with progression and reflect a racing mind at night; the type that someone has to fight to fall asleep. I hope to express multiple emotions, such as humor, sassiness, being fed up, gratitude, and tiredness. Perhaps all the endings will lead to drifting off to sleep except for one where the player cannot fall asleep, or it goes back to the begining of the thoughts to mimic a looping mind. I want to try out different path types, and finally want to learn how to make it so that when a word is clicked on, it drops down more information instead of bringing us to the next passage (like in "Space Frog" by npckc where you can click on text for more info and it stays on the same page).
