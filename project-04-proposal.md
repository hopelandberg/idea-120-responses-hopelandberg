 explain in about 1 paragraph what content you'll include in your portfolio and how it will be organized.

For my portfolio, I plan on keeping a minimalist style for the time being and using comforting colors (such as a muted/pastel rainbow palette). That'll reflect the colors I've chosen for various projects and not take away from future things I add to the portfolio (since sometimes my art is bright!). I want to keep using this portfolio past this class to add more projects to and put a link in my Linktree to this. For now, the content will include an about me, project 1: the flarf poem, project 2: the zoom call background, project 3: the twine game, and a fourth project for fun (maybe a piece of art I had in a gallery recently). I'll have my content on different pages and have a handful of aesthetic design choices I'd like to incorporate, such as: animated cursor, social media bar/links, and possibly sound (depending on time and ability). 

For the projects, I'm thinking of having still shots of them and you can hover and click on the images (or a link..) to take the user to external links to show off the projects better (such as the flarf page, the twine game, and maybe use vimeo to show off the zoom background better? Or just have lots of pictures for the zoom project..). 

Perhaps to set up my future self for better success with using this, I could make a 5th project page that is just a gallery where I can keep adding pictures as time goes on, it could be labled "other art" or something like that. "collection dump," "art dump," something like that! 

Maybe projects 1-3 will go into a page called something like school projects, or digital art
Maybe I want to break up the 5  later into categories like: crochet, watercolors, acrylics, oils, poems
