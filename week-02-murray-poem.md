## The Stories We Tell ~~that cave us in or set us free?~~

**First,** fire creates a shadow dance across cave drawings  
Like a dream materializes endless forms: plays, radio, telephones _and more_  
_Same stories across multimedia_  
Casting different shadows in the caverns of the mind  
**Now,** computer power mesmerizes us all
